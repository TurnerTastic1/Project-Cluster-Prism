# Project Cluster Prism

Project Cluster Prism - A FullStack project developed by [TurnerTastic](https://github.com/TurnerTastic1)

Uses MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) tech stack

This was my first attempt at building a fullstack project. Overall I learned the importance of documenting API's, keeping a clean workspace, and having a structured plan before filling my repo with useless code files. I may come back to this project in the future and complete it, but as of now I am pursuing other interests with things like Swift, Rust and other popular languages/frameworks.
